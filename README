libtuntap 0.3
=============

Description
-----------

libtuntap is a library for configuring TUN or TAP devices in a portable manner.

TUN and TAP are virtual networking devices which allow userland applications
to receive packets sent to it. The userland applications can also send their
own packets to the devices and they will be forwarded to the kernel.

This is useful for developping tunnels, private networks or virtualisation
systems.
